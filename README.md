# Overview
In this project, I created a simple web-based to-do list application using JavaScript. This application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks. It's a minimalistic, yet practical demonstration of JavaScript's capabilities in building interactive web applications.

The primary purpose of developing this software is to explore and practice JavaScript, focusing on its language syntax, event handling, and DOM manipulation. By creating a functional to-do list, I aimed to apply the fundamentals of JavaScript in a real-world context.

# Development Environment

I developed this project using the following tools and technologies:

- **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code
- **Web Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, I found the following websites particularly helpful:

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/): MDN provides comprehensive and well-explained documentation for web technologies, including JavaScript.

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/): W3Schools offers practical examples and tutorials for web development, including JavaScript.

# Future Work

As part of future work, I plan to:

- Implement data persistence: Store tasks in local storage or a backend server to retain them across sessions.
- Add task prioritization: Allow users to set priorities for tasks.
- Enhance user interface: Improve the design and layout of the to-do list for a better user experience.
- Include due dates and notifications: Implement reminders for upcoming tasks.
- Collaborative features: Enable sharing and collaborating on task lists with others.

These future enhancements will make the to-do list application more feature-rich and useful for daily task management.
